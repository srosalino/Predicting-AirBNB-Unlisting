**Overview**

The explosive growth of the sharing economy, exemplified by platforms like Airbnb, has significantly transformed the hospitality industry. As more property owners leverage these platforms to monetize their houses, understanding the dynamics of property listings becomes crucial. This project aims to harness the power of Natural Language Processing (NLP) to predict whether a property listed on Airbnb will be unlisted in the next quarter. This predictive capability is essential for hosts and the platform itself, offering insights that can drive decision-making, enhance user experience, and improve platform strategies. 
In this project, we utilize a comprehensive dataset provided by Airbnb, which includes detailed property descriptions, host biographies, and guest reviews. The challenge lies in analyzing this vast corpus of textual data to discern patterns and indicators that might signal a propertyâ€™s likelihood of being unlisted. By leveraging advanced NLP techniques and machine learning models, we aim to build a robust classification model that can accurately predict the listing status of properties.
